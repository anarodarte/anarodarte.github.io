          <h3>Research Enthusiast</h3>
          <p>I started my career in the healthcare field. After a being on the frontlines of COVID and working in labs, I realized I gained a plethora of experience in research methods and problem solving. I began searching for ways I could apply these methods in other fields.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
          <h3>Natural Art Lover</h3>
          <p>Over time, I realized I had given up all my hobbies and interests to pursue my degree in healthcare. During COVID, I began exploring my creative side using traditional physical and modern digital mediums. This opened up my eyes to the possibility of combining my passion for art/design and research methods.</p>

          <h3>Pursuing UX/UI Design</h3>
          <p>In early 2020, I decided to start teaching myself UX/UI Design. I started off with Udemy courses, went on to complete the Google Certification in Foundations of UX Design, and finished a UX/UI Design bootcamp with the University of California Irvine.</p>

          <h3>Traveling</h3>
          <p>I love sight-seeing, specifically locations with great views. Being from below sea level New Orleans, mountain views were non-existent to me so they are always worth the hike (no matter how long it takes me to get there). </p>
